# LLM BOARD – Decision Support System

LLM BOARD is a local decision-support system that simulates a board of advisors
by collecting multiple independent AI perspectives and synthesizing them into a
single recommendation.

This project focuses on analytical thinking, decision quality, and bias reduction.
