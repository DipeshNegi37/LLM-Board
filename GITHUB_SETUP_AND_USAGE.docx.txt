1. Project Overview

LLM BOARD is a local decision-support system designed to simulate a board of advisors using multiple AI models.

Each model evaluates a question independently, and a final synthesized recommendation is produced.
The project focuses on decision quality, bias reduction, and analytical thinking, not AI model development.

2. Why This Project Exists

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

Structured decision-making

Multi-perspective analysis

Clear documentation

Cost-aware and ethical system design

This project is intended for Data Analysts, Business Analysts, and Project Managers.

3. System Requirements

OS: Windows / macOS / Linux

RAM: Minimum 8 GB

GPU: Not required

Internet: Required only for installation

4. Installing Ollama (Local AI Runtime)

Download Ollama from official website

Install using default settings

Verify installation:

ollama --version

5. Download Required Models

Run the following commands:

ollama pull llama3
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull phi


These models are free and run locally.

6. Project Setup
Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/llm-board-decision-support.git
cd llm-board-decision-support

Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

7. Running the System
python src/run_board.py


Enter a business or decision-related question when prompted.

8. Understanding the Output

Each AI model provides an independent perspective

Responses are not influenced by each other

Chairman logic synthesizes insights into a single recommendation

This mirrors real-world decision review meetings.

9. Example Use Cases

Pricing decisions

Risk analysis

Feature prioritization

Process improvement

Strategy discussions

10. Ethical & Cost Considerations

Fully local execution

No data sent externally

Zero API cost

Respect model licenses

11. Conclusion

LLM BOARD demonstrates how structured thinking and system design can improve decision-making without relying on expensive or opaque AI systems.
